# Architecture Vision Document (AVD) for Aura

## 1. Executive Summary

Aura is a multi-platform application that provides users with personalized predictions based on their Telegram profile. It will be available as a Telegram Mini App and a native Android & iOS application. The application will integrate AI-based prediction models and offer a seamless user experience.

## 2. Business Goals

- Enhance user engagement by providing personalized predictions.
- Expand accessibility by supporting multiple platforms (Telegram, Android, iOS).
- Ensure a scalable and responsive backend architecture.
- Provide a smooth, lightweight user experience with fast API responses.

## 3. System Overview

Aura consists of the following core components:

<strong>Frontend</strong>: Developed for Telegram Mini App, Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose), and iOS (SwiftUI).

<strong>Backend</strong>: Developed in .NET 8, exposing APIs via gRPC/REST.

<strong>Database</strong>: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching.

<strong>AI/ML Integration</strong>: Uses OpenAI or custom ML models for prediction generation.

<strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Deployed on Kubernetes (AKS/EKS/GKE) with CI/CD automation.

## 4. Architecture Overview

### 4.1 Deployment Architecture

#### Frontend:

- Telegram Mini App (React, integrated with Telegram API)
- Android App (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose)
- iOS App (Swift, SwiftUI)

#### Backend:

- .NET 8-based microservices
- gRPC/REST API for communication
- PostgreSQL as the main database
- Redis for caching

#### Infrastructure:

- Hosted on AWS/Azure/GCP

- Kubernetes-managed containers

- CI/CD using GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps

- OpenTelemetry for observability

### 4.2 Logical Architecture

User Interface Layer: Mini App UI, Android/iOS UI

Application Layer: Backend API handling requests, integrating business logic

Data Layer: PostgreSQL, Redis

AI Engine: Uses GPT-based predictions, custom ML models

## 5. Technology Stack

| Component               | Technology                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Frontend (Mini App)** | React, Telegram API       |
| **Frontend (Android)**  | Kotlin, Jetpack Compose   |
| **Frontend (iOS)**      | Swift, SwiftUI            |
| **Backend**             | .NET 8, gRPC, REST        |
| **Database**            | PostgreSQL, Redis         |
| **Infrastructure**      | Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure |
| **AI/ML**               | OpenAI, Custom ML Models  |

6. API & Integration

- Telegram API: Fetch user data and authenticate Mini App users.

- Payment Integration: In-app purchases (Google Play, Apple Pay, Telegram Pay).

- AI Model API: Integration with OpenAI or self-hosted models.

7. Security Considerations

OAuth2 / JWT-based Authentication

Telegram Bot Authentication

Data Encryption (TLS, AES-256 for storage)

Rate Limiting and API Throttling

Compliance with GDPR

8. Performance & Scalability

Auto-scaling Kubernetes deployment

CDN for faster content delivery

Optimized database queries and caching (Redis)

Efficient event-driven processing for ML workloads

9. Development & Deployment Strategy

CI/CD Pipelines for automatic deployments

Versioned API releases

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Automated Testing: Unit, Integration, E2E

10. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                     | Mitigation Strategy                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telegram API Rate Limits | Implement caching and request batching                         |
| AI Response Latency      | Optimize model inference, use local ML inference when possible |
| Security Threats         | Implement secure authentication and authorization policies     |

11. Conclusion

This architecture ensures that Aura delivers a fast, scalable, and secure experience across Telegram, Android, and iOS platforms. The integration of AI/ML models enhances user engagement, while the cloud-based infrastructure guarantees reliability and performance.
